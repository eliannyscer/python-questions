# Is python numpy better than lists?

NumPy Package is better than Python Lists in the following ways:

- The arrays created with Numpy package are `more compact` than Python Lists.
- `Fast` as compared to the Python List.
- The arrays created in Numpy are more `efficient and convenient` to use.
- It provides `more functionality` than the inbuilt Python List.
- Many `vector and matrix` operations are available in Numpy for `free`.
- It is Open Source.
- Consumes less memory.

## Additional information

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy arrays facilitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data. Typically, such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using Python’s built-in sequences. NumPy is not another programming language, `is a Python extension module`. It provides fast and efficient operations on arrays of homogeneous data.
