# What is the difference between NumPy and SciPy?

NumPy and SciPy are two very important libraries to deal with the upcoming technological concepts. They are useful in the fields of data science, machine learning, etc. Both are convenient options for their functions, modules, and packages.

They are `different conceptually` but have `similar functionality`. The combined functions of both are necessary to work on different concepts.

The NumPy library contains a variety of functions that arenâ€™t defined in depth. We use a combination of SciPy and NumPy for fast and efficient scientific and mathematical computations.

## Differences

1) NumPy stands for `Numerical Python` while SciPy stands for `Scientific Python`.

2) NumPy is the basic library for defining arrays and `simple mathematical problems`, while SciPy is used for more `complex problems` like numerical integration and optimization and machine learning.

3) NumPy is written in C and it is `faster` than SciPy in all aspects of execution.NumPy is generally for performing basic operations like sorting, indexing, and array manipulation

However, it is the best option to use both because they complement each other.

## Additional information

`What is SciPy?` - It is the abbreviation of Scientific Python. SciPy is a library that uses NumPy for more mathematical functions. SciPy uses NumPy arrays as the basic data structure, and comes with modules for various commonly used tasks in scientific programming, including linear algebra, integration (calculus), ordinary differential equation solving, and signal processing.

`What is NumPy?` -It is the abbreviation of Numerical Python. NumPy is a low level library written in `C` and `Fortran` for high level mathematical functions. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays and overcomes the problem of running slower algorithms.
