# How can you Get the Google cache age of any URL or web page?

You only need to use the following URL format:

```python
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:URL
```

Be sure to replace `URL` with the proper web address of the page or site whose cache you want to retrieve and see the time for.

`Example:`

```python
http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:eliprogramming.com
```
