# Processing modes

`To open a file c:scores.txt for writing, we use:`

`A)` file = open(“c:scores.txt”, “r”)

`B)` file = open(“c:scores.txt”, “w”)

`C)` file = open(file = “c:scores.txt”, “r”)

`D)` file = open(file = “c:scores.txt”, “o”)

`Answer: B`. The "w" is used to indicate that file is in write-only mode, this mean that you open for writing.
